# Digit Classification using ANN | MNIST Dataset

This project is part of my ongoing journey into Deep Learning, Neural Networks, and Artificial Intelligence. It focuses on building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify digits (0–9) using the popular MNIST dataset.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train an ANN that can accurately recognise and classify digits. By learning from thousands of labelled digit images, the model is able to generalise and make predictions on unseen data.

### 🔍 Key Highlights:
- Achieved **97.8% accuracy** on the test set.
- Used **1 hidden layer** with **128 nodes**.
- Applied **ReLU** activation in the hidden layer for better learning performance.
- Used **Softmax** activation in the output layer (10 nodes) for multi-class classification.

## 🚀 Features

- Built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
- Efficient model architecture for fast convergence.
- Trained and evaluated on the **MNIST** dataset.
- Clean and well-commented code for better understanding and reproducibility.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - `TensorFlow`
  - `Keras`
  - `NumPy`
